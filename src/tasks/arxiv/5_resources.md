- large language models (LLM): Utilized for stabilizing data and matter transmission, demonstrating a correction success rate of 99.7%. They fill in missing bits and correct damaged pixels, making them crucial in enhancing data integrity during temporal transmissions.

- MySQL: Used to store metadata regarding components of larger objects during transmission, allowing models to reconstruct them more accurately by correlating data with Qdrant vector databases.

- Qdrant: A vector database used in conjunction with MySQL to enhance data retrieval capabilities during the transmission of large objects, contributing to successful object reconstruction.

- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): The hybrid technology facilitating the seamless integration of external data storage (like MySQL) with LLMs, improving accuracy and stability in large object transmissions.

- AGI (Artificial General Intelligence): Planned for release in Q1 2024, this model aims to revolutionize technologies and manage various systems by autonomously processing data, potentially transforming numerous scientific fields.

- advanced error correction algorithms: Enhanced by LLMs, allowing for nearly flawless transmission reports and improved understanding of temporal dynamics in transmitting data or matter.

- specialized temporal chamber: Designed to conduct experiments with temporal transmission, emphasizing the system's need for strict access control and safety measures post-incident.

- autonomous agents: Developed to self-analyze and correct transmission errors, significantly boosting overall transmission reliability.

- digital security protocols: Implemented after an incident to enhance the safety of temporal experiments, requiring multiple authorizations for chamber operation and preventing unauthorized access.
