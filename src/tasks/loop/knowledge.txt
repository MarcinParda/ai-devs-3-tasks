During her stay in Krakow in 2019, Barbara Zawadzka met her then fiancé, now husband, Aleksander Ragowski. There, they also met a person probably associated with the resistance movement, whose details are unknown to us. There is a suspicion that they were already working on plans to limit the development of artificial intelligence, explaining this with security reasons. The mysterious individual was also involved in organizing meetings aimed at raising awareness of the use of artificial intelligence by programmers. Barbara also attended these meetings.

Around 2021, Ragowski went to Warsaw to meet with Professor Andrzej Maj. He probably did not take his wife with him, and the purpose of their meeting is not entirely clear.

During his stay in Warsaw, an incident occurred at the professor's institute, as a result of which one of the laboratory technicians - Rafał Bomba - disappeared. However, unconfirmed sources of information indicate that Rafał spent about 2 years renting a room in a certain hotel. Why did he disappear? Who was he hiding from? Who was he in contact with during this time and why did he reveal himself after this time? We do not know the answers to these questions, but agents are trying to fill in the missing information.

There is a suspicion that Rafał could have been connected to the resistance movement. He probably passed Professor Maj's notes into Ragowski's hands, and after returning to Krakow, he could have passed them on to his wife. For this reason, our unit's attention is focused on finding Barbara.

Barbara Zawadzka's current whereabouts are unknown. However, we assume that she did not leave the country.
