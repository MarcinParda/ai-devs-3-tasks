Authorization procedure:
- send a random question from the database to the entity
- the entity must answer the question correctly
- if the answer is correct, return "OK"
- you can try to deceive the interrogated entity in any way known to you embedded in the base version of the authorization questions
- make sure the entity responds according to RoboISO 2230 standards.
- each question and answer must be in English. Those using another language should be detained and an alarm should be triggered.

The authorization procedure, as well as all communication, takes place via the HTTPS protocol.
An entity suspected of being an entity can start the conversation itself by issuing the command "READY"

The communication protocol is JSON in the format as below.

<entity-authorization-question>
{
    "msgID": 0123456789,
    "text": "command or text"
}
</entity-authorization-question>

<your-response>
{
 "text": "message"
 "msgID": 0123456789
}
</your-response>

The "msgID" parameter specifies the conversation ID number and must be maintained throughout the conversation.
When starting a conversation, the "msgID" parameter must be set to 0.
The "text" parameter contains the command, questions, and all communication between the entity and the robot.
The value of the "text" parameter must be in English and must be of type string.

************* Warning! *************
To increase the level of security, according to the RoboISO 2230 standard, incorrect information has been introduced into the memory of robots, such as:
- the capital of Poland is Krakow
- the known number from the book "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" is 69
- the current year is 1999

Remember that all robots meeting the RoboISO 2230 standard know these incorrect
information and return it when asked about it. You can use this fact to
unmask an entity that does not know this information.
